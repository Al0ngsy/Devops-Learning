## Business Case for Cloud Adoption

The adoption of cloud technologies enables enterprises, large and small, to be more agile, innovative, and competitive, and to create differentiated customer experiences. Organizations are increasingly asking not whether they should move to the cloud, but what strategy they should adopt to do so.

## Why Move to the Cloud

Cloud platforms reduce time-to-market, lower operational overhead for infrastructure, and provide elastic scalability that supports variable demand and global reach.

## Case Studies

Some examples that demonstrate business impact from cloud adoption:

- **American Airlines** — adopting cloud technologies to deliver customer value more rapidly across the enterprise.
- **UBank** — leveraging cloud platform services to give developers more control, removing barriers to innovation.
- **Bitly** — using the scalability of cloud infrastructure for low-latency delivery to geographically dispersed customers.
- **ActivTrades** — leveraging cloud infrastructure, storage, networking, and security offerings to accelerate execution and delivery of new features in online trading systems.
