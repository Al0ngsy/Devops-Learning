 # Cloud Deployment Models

Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how cloud resources and services are made available to users. There are four main deployment models available on the cloud:

### 1. Public Cloud
- **Ownership & Management:** Service provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the physical infrastructure (data centers, servers, networking equipment, storage).
- **Access:** Users access virtualized computing, networking, and storage resources as services.
- **When to use:** For general-purpose workloads that benefit from rapid provisioning, scale, and lower operational overhead (e.g., web apps, analytics).

### 2. Private Cloud
- **Exclusive Use:** Infrastructure provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization.
- **Location:** Can be internal (on-premises) or hosted on a public cloud as a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
- **Management:** Owned, managed, and operated by the organization or the cloud provider.
- **When to use:** When strict control, compliance, or data residency requirements demand isolated infrastructure (e.g., financial services, healthcare).

### 3. Hybrid Cloud
- **Combination:** Connects an organization’s on-premise private cloud and a third-party public cloud.
- **Benefits:** Offers a single, flexible infrastructure leveraging features and benefits of both public and private clouds.
- **When to use:** When you need to keep sensitive workloads on-premises while bursting to the public cloud for extra capacity or services.

### 4. Community Cloud
- **Shared Use:** Infrastructure provisioned for use by a community of organizations with shared concerns.
- **Management:** Ownership, management, and operation can be by one or more organizations in the community, a third-party provider, or both.
- **When to use:** For collaborative projects across organizations with similar regulatory or compliance needs (e.g., research consortia, government agencies).
