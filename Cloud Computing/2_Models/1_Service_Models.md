 # Cloud Service Models

With IaaS, the cloud provider manages physical resources.

- Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure Virtual Machines
- When to choose: You need low-level control over VMs, networking, and storage.

With PaaS, the provider manages the platform infrastructure.

- Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, Azure App Service
- When to choose: You want to focus on code without managing the underlying OS or middleware.

In the SaaS model, the provider hosts and manages the applications and data.

- Examples: Salesforce, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365
- When to choose: You need a ready-to-use application with minimal operational overhead.

The key components of cloud infrastructure are:

- Physical data centers
- Compute
- Network
- Storage

Platform-as-a-Service is a cloud computing model that provides customers with a complete platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure.

The high level of abstraction, support services, runtime environments, rapid deployment mechanisms, and middleware capabilities distinguishes PaaS clouds.

PaaS advantages are:

- Scalability
- Faster time to market products and services
- Greater agility and innovation

Software-as-a-Service is a cloud offering that provides users with access to a service provider’s cloud-based software.

SaaS characteristics are:

- Multitenant architecture
- Security, compliance, and maintenance
- Customization of applications
- Subscription model
- Scaling

SaaS advantages are:

- Direct procurement of solutions
- Improved workforce productivity and efficiency
- Enable distribution of software costs
