# DevOps Measuring and Metrics

## Measuring and Rewarding

- **Measure and reward what you want to improve.**
- People seek information on what is rewarded and then seek to do that.
- **If you want people to be social, then measure them being social.**

## Types of Metrics

### Social and DevOps Metrics

- **Social metrics**: Measuring social interactions leads to improved teamwork.
- **DevOps metrics**: Allow you to see the progression toward your goals.

### Vanity vs. Actionable Metrics

- **Vanity metrics**: May be appealing at first but offer limited actionable insights.
- **Actionable metrics**: Provide meaningful ways to measure your processes and take action toward goals.

## DevOps Actionable Metrics

Key DevOps actionable metrics include:

- **Mean lead time**: How long it takes for an idea to get to production
- **Release frequency**: How often releases are deployed
- **Change failure rate**: The rate of failure from pushing new releases out
- **Mean time to recovery (MTTR)**: How long it takes to recover from a failure

## Problem Resolution Philosophy

**DevOps changes the objective of problem resolution from failure prevention to failure recovery.**

## Measuring Team Culture

- Dr. Nicole Forsgren developed **cultural statements for measuring team culture**.
- These statements assess:
  - Information sharing
  - How failures are handled
  - Collaboration
  - Openness to new ideas

## Failures as Learning Opportunities

**Failures are learning opportunities that should not be punished.**
