 # 3. Config

**Configuration** refers to the settings and parameters that determine how an app behaves in different environments.

- Store settings in **environment variables** (e.g., `.env` files or k8s ConfigMaps) or configuration files, rather than hardcoding into the app's code.
- This allows for greater flexibility and easier management of different environments (development, staging, production).
